# Todo list 9B  

### Hello and welcome!  
<br />
You have somehow stumbled upon the 9 billionth todo list app! Lucky you! I mean really, what are the odds of that? <br />
And yes the "9B" stands for, 9 Billionth. <br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm glad you are here and thank you for stopping by. I am actually quite proud of this application for a couple of reasons. This started
from the Jetbrains PyCharm tutorial on Django and I was able to expand upon it further, so that is pretty cool! I used Bootstrap5 for styling which I am
becoming very fond of, and getting a little better with. <br />  
<br />
On more advanced topics I am also proud to say that I have unit tests! What newbie todo list has tests?! Even more exciting though is the GitHub
Action that triggers on commits and attempts to build the app as well as runs the tests! I think that is super cool!  
<br />
